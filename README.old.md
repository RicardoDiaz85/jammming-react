# Jammming - React Web App

## Purpose
Jammming is a web application built with React that allows users to search the Spotify library, create custom playlists, and save them to their Spotify account. The app leverages the Spotify API to display search results, manage playlists, and interact with user accounts. The goal of this project is to explore front-end development with React while working with APIs and managing state effectively.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Spotify API**: Provides access to Spotify's vast music catalog, enabling song search and playlist management.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core scripting language for app logic and functionality.
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped styling for React components, keeping styles modular and maintainable.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control for managing code and collaboration.

## Features
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search the Spotify library for songs by title, artist, album, or genre.
- **Display Search Results**: Results are shown with relevant song details such as title, artist, and album.
- **Custom Playlist Creation**: Users can create a playlist by adding individual tracks to their list.
- **Save Playlist to Spotify**: After creating a playlist, users can save it directly to their personal Spotify account (authentication required).
- **Responsive UI**: The app is designed to work across various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Future Work
- **Authentication**: Implement a full authentication flow with Spotify so users can log in and save playlists securely.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for API requests, such as invalid search terms or issues with the Spotify API.
- **Advanced Playlist Features**: Allow users to reorder tracks within a playlist, remove tracks, and edit playlist details (name, description).
- **Styling Improvements**: Enhance the visual design and animations for a more polished user experience.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test and ensure compatibility with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
